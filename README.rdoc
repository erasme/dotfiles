= Inspired from Ryan Bates Dot Files (https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/leucos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles

If you don't have Ruby, install it or just run :

  ./install_ruby.sh

Now you can install the dotfiles :

  rake install

You can then bootstrap your vim plugins by invoking :

  bootstrap_vim.sh

The plugins are managed with pathogen and Git submodules, can't be easier.

You probably want to remove some scripts in bash.d according to your configuration.
